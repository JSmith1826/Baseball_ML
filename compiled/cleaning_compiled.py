## Compiled Python for College Baseball game data cleaning

### TAKE SCRAPPED DATA FOR COLLEGE GAMES CLEAN AND STANDARIZE, PREPARE TO GET WEATHER RESULTS FOR NO BOX SCORE GAMES

## Pathe to raw source data

path = '../data/stats/ncaa/ESPN_2016-2022_baseball_scrape.csv'

## Load Libraries
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime

from tqdm import tqdm

## Load Data
df = pd.read_csv(path)


## Write the replacements to a dictionary
replacements = {'Ole Miss': 'University of Mississippi',
                'NC State': 'North Carolina State University',
                'Miami': 'University of Miami',

## Replace the names in the df_simple

df['home_team'].replace(replacements, inplace=True)
df['away_team'].replace(replacements, inplace=True)

## Find rows with empty away_team_runs and home_team_runs and drop them
df = df.dropna(subset=['away_team_runs', 'home_team_runs'])
# drop rows that have a game_id , those are covered in other dataset
df = df[df['game_id'].isna()]
# Dop the game_id column
df.drop(columns=['game_id'], inplace=True)

# for rows with empty 'game_info' copy the 'home_team' column to a new column called 'venue'
df.loc[df['game_info'].isna(), 'venue'] = df['home_team']

## Dictionary to assign locations for games at nuetral sites

neutral_site_dict = {'SOUTHERN CONF TOURNAMENT AT GREENVILLE SC': 'Fluor Field Greenville, S.C.',

                     'Big 12 Tournament (2021)': 'Bricktown Ballpark'}

## Apply the dictionary to the game_info column and copy to venue column
df['n_venue'] = df['game_info'].map(neutral_site_dict).fillna(df['venue'])

## Do a fuzzymatch on the 'team' column to get the team name from the venue_df and the home_team column
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz

## Create a list of all of the teams in the venue_df

## Do a match and store the results in a dataframe

## If the match score is 91 or graeter, merge the Stadium, City, State, Confference, Capacity, Opened columns to the df_simple

## Create a list of the teams that matched with a score of 90 or greater
matched_teams = list(matches[matches['score'] >= 91]['team'])

## Create a dataframe with a the matched teams and their data from the venue_df

## how many teams matched from the simple_teams list, show list of teams that did not find good match
print(f'{len(matched_teams)} of {len(simple_teams)} teams matched')

## Show the teams that did not match
print(f'Teams that did not match: {list(set(simple_teams) - set(matched_teams))}')
