# Baseball_ML
A Project to use Machine Learning to evaluate baseball fields using geographic / spatial data and game results


## The Basic Outline of the Readme Code Explanation:

Data Sources:
Game Data - ESPN.com college baseball scoreboard
NCAA Venue information - Wikipedia
Geographic Info - self generated in google maps and earth

## ETL
- taking the raw kml file and creating the dataframe full of geospacial stats
- show scraping code used
	- describe the different between games with access to box score and those without
		- boxscore games able to get exact time home runs hit by each team and all locations are easy
	- no box score games were very sparse and alot of data needed to be massaged to create a dataframe that is nearly as ferature rich as the other
- CODE OF TRANFORMATION / CLeaning of both sets of game datasets
